    <h1>Segmentation Process at Finch & Olive</h1>

    <!-- Case Study Section -->
    <div id="case-study">
        <div id="case-study">
 

    <p>In the bustling heart of London, nestled between the historic buildings of Covent Garden, was a small but elegant restaurant called Finch & Olive. Run by Amelia Finch, a young and ambitious restaurateur, the business was doing well. But Amelia knew it could do better. With the competition around every corner and new eateries constantly popping up, she realised that without a clear direction, Finch & Olive might just blend into the background.</p>

    <p>Amelia had always been driven by a passion for fresh, locally sourced British ingredients, but she had never taken the time to truly understand her customer base. So one autumn morning, over a cup of strong coffee, Amelia sat with her team to map out a strategic plan for Finch & Olive’s growth.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Situation Analysis</h3>
    
    <p>The first step was agreeing on an objective. "What do we want to achieve?" she asked her team. They agreed that they needed to increase both weekday lunchtime traffic and their evening dining numbers, while also exploring ways to attract more business clients. "We can't just rely on foot traffic and hope for the best," Amelia said, tapping her pen against the notebook. "We need to understand who our customers really are."</p>

    <p>The team began with a situation analysis, examining their current clientele. The restaurant saw a steady mix of tourists and locals during dinner hours, but lunchtime was more erratic. They weren’t quite sure who their regulars were during the day.</p>

    <p>Amelia decided to dig into the data. She asked her server team to note down any patterns over the next month. What she found was that during lunchtime, a few regulars from the nearby offices would pop in for a quick bite, but their preferences varied widely. Meanwhile, during the evenings, couples and tourists were coming for a leisurely dining experience, often drawn by the restaurant’s traditional British fare.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Identifying Key Variables</h3>
    
    <p>Once the analysis was complete, it was time to identify key segmentation variables. Amelia decided to break her audience down into two main groups: the consumer audience and the business audience.</p>

    <p>For the consumer audience, she looked at demographic and behavioural variables. She realised they had two key segments:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Young professionals and local workers:</strong> who needed quick but satisfying lunches.</li>
        <li><strong>Tourists and leisure diners:</strong> coming in the evenings for a traditional British experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the business audience, she realised the untapped potential of business professionals in the area. By focusing on B2B variables, she could cater to corporate lunches, private events, and even offer catering for local offices. These segments could be further divided into:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate clients from finance and law firms:</strong> who preferred high-end dining and private spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Tech start-ups and creative companies:</strong> who might enjoy more casual, flexible offerings like shared platters or team meals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Developing Segment Profiles</h3>

    <p>The next task was to develop profiles for each segment, ensuring their needs were clear and distinct.</p>

    <p><strong>For young professionals:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age group:</strong> 25-40 years</li>
        <li><strong>Dining preference:</strong> Quick, healthy lunch options</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> 12:00–14:00, during their work breaks</li>
        <li><strong>Dining behaviour:</strong> On-the-go, limited time to eat but wanting fresh, high-quality meals</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> They prefer ordering via apps or pre-booking a table</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For tourists and leisure diners:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age group:</strong> 30-60 years</li>
        <li><strong>Dining preference:</strong> Traditional British dishes, long dining experiences</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> 18:00–21:00, often a relaxed evening out</li>
        <li><strong>Dining behaviour:</strong> Interested in seasonal, locally sourced dishes, and often enjoy wine pairings or dessert</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For the business audience,</strong> the profiles varied based on company size and sector:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate professionals from finance/law:</strong> They want a private, quiet space for meetings, with set lunch menus that offer convenience. These clients value exclusivity and are happy to spend on higher-end dishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Tech and creative professionals:</strong> More laid-back, they prefer a flexible menu with options for sharing, offering both vegetarian and creative fusion options.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Adjusting the Offerings</h3>

    <p>With the segment profiles in hand, Amelia realised that her current menu wasn’t optimised for all these different audiences. The lunch menu, for example, needed to be faster and more focused on grab-and-go options for the young professionals. She introduced more salads, bowls, and healthy wraps that could be ordered in advance through delivery apps.</p>

    <p>For the evening diners, she leaned into the traditional British culinary theme but decided to introduce seasonal tasting menus that would appeal to the tourists seeking an authentic experience. She also added an afternoon tea offering to attract both tourists and locals for a more leisurely late afternoon visit.</p>

    <p>For the business clients, she created two distinct offers: a formal lunch menu for corporate meetings and a more casual platter offering for tech and creative professionals, allowing them to have a communal and collaborative dining experience.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

    <p>As the team rolled out these changes, Amelia made sure they avoided a few key mistakes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Over-segmentation:</strong> She was careful not to create too many micro-segments that would make marketing and menu adjustments overly complex.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring behavioural insights:</strong> While demographic information was useful, she paid extra attention to the behaviour of her guests—how they ordered, when they visited, and what experiences they sought in her restaurant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>Six months after implementing the new strategy, Finch & Olive saw a notable change. Lunchtime traffic had increased by 30%, largely thanks to the new app-friendly lunch menu and pre-order options. Evening sales remained strong, but with the introduction of the tasting menus, the average spend per customer had increased.</p>

    <p>The restaurant was also starting to receive more enquiries from local businesses looking to book out space for lunches and private events, providing Amelia with a new, steady stream of income from her B2B audience.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn’t just about better marketing or a new menu. By understanding her customer segments and meeting their needs more effectively, Amelia had turned Finch & Olive into a thriving, versatile restaurant, serving both the busy professionals of London and its eager tourists alike.</p>
